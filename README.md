# WordShop
WordShop is a tool for workshopping your writing projects. With it you can exchange thoughtful critiques of works-in-progress with  fellow authors and readers. Any kind of writing is welcome, whether non-fiction or fiction, blogpost or poetry, ad copy or novel. As long as it's made with words you can workshop it here.
